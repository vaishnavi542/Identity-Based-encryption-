This is My Final Year project "Identity-Based Encryption: A Key to Data Privacy in Permissioned Blockchain," 
you implemented Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) to enhance data privacy in permissioned blockchain networks. 
The project utilized cryptographic techniques for secure data sharing and access control while leveraging blockchain technology to create a decentralized data management system. 
The encryption mechanism used users' identities as public keys, reducing reliance on traditional key distribution methods.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Hyperledger Fabric/Ethereum, 
Python, 
PyCryptodome/OpenSSL, 
Smart Contracts (Solidity), 
SQL/NoSQL Databases, and Machine Learning (if used for security enhancements).
